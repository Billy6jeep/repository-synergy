# Ubuntu installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the following in your terminal:

#Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install python2.7 git python2.7-dev python-setuptools python-pip libevent-dev git python-dev

#Download bitHopper
git clone git://github.com/c00w/bitHopper.git

#Move into the folder
cd bitHopper

#install python dependencies
sudo python setup.py install --upgrade
(If this doesn't work run sudo pip install --upgrade requests btcnet_info flask gevent mechanize setuptools)

#run bitHopper
python run.py

# Go to localhost:8339 and click on workers. Add some pool login information
# Make sure to add some backup pools such as eligius or mtred
# bitHopper will return no work if there are no safe pools to mine

# Point your miner at localhost:8337

Tested and working in Ubuntu 12.04.

# Mining deepbit
There is one other dependency, you need to install numpy
sudo apt-get install python-numpy

# Other Linux Installations
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Use pip to install your libraries. We need fairly recent versions of everything.
The libraries bundled with debian are too old.

# Instructions for Windows users
-----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: IF YOU ARE RUNNING LOTS OF MINERS USE LINUX.
It's a lot more stable and takes less modifications.

Download and install
1. Python
http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi
Make sure you are using the 32 bit version.

2. Greenlet
http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/g/greenlet/greenlet-0.3.4.win32-py2.7.exe

3. Gevent
http://gevent.googlecode.com/files/gevent-1.0b2.win32-py2.7.msi
It is recommended that you install the latest version because some users reported that earlier versions to 1.x cause problems with the latest versions of BitHopper (see https://github.com/c00w/bitHopper/issues/671#issuecomment-7496513 )

4. SetupTools
http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/s/setuptools/setuptools-0.6c11.win32-py2.7.exe#md5=57e1e64f6b7c7f1d2eddfc9746bbaf20

7. BitHopper
github.com/c00w/bitHopper
Go to downloads and hit zip. Extract the zip to your desktop

8. Bundled Dependencies
Enter the bitHopper folder
Open a console and navigate to the directory where you unzipped BitHopper.
Run the command
> C:\Python27\python.exe setup.py install


Running bitHopper
Open a console and navigate to the directory where you unzipped BitHopper.
Run the command
> C:\Python27\python.exe run.py 

#Where to point you miners
Have your miner use http://localhost:8337/

# Configuring user settings
Worker Configuration page: http://localhost:8339/worker
BitHopper Stats page: http://localhost:8339/stats

# Large Scale Users
-------------------------
If you are mining with more than ~5GH/s you should make sure to do the following.
1) 
Make sure you have libevent installed if you are on linux
2) 
Put in a couple of workers for each pool you are mining at.
Lots of pools have a global rate limiter for how fast they will accept
work from a single worker
3) If you are running out of connection sockets on the client side send me
an email and I'll walk you through setting up bitHopper to run with uwsgi

# Running the test suite
mv custom_pools_test/test_pool custom_pools
python tests.py
