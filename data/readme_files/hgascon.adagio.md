### Structural Analysis and Detection of Android Malware

Adagio contains several modules that implement the method described in the
paper:

**[Structural Detection of Android Malware using Embedded Call Graphs](http://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~hgascon/docs/2013b-aisec.pdf)**  
Hugo Gascon, Fabian Yamaguchi, Daniel Arp, Konrad Rieck  
*ACM Workshop on Security and Artificial Intelligence (AISEC) November 2013*

These modules allow to extract and label the call graphs from a series of
Android APKs or DEX files and apply an explicit feature map that captures
their structural relationships. The analysis module provides classes to desing a binary
or multiclass classification experiment using the vectorial representation and
support vector machines.
