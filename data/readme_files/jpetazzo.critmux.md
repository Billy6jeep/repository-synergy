# Freeze. Thaw. Repeat.

This is a tech demo of [CRIU] and [Docker] integration, featuring [tmux].

See it live in this [ASCII video demo]!

1. ``docker run -t -i --privileged --name critmux jpetazzo/critmux``
2. Do stuff in tmux. Don't know what to do? Just type a few characters.
3. From another terminal, ``docker stop critmux``. Container stops.
4. ``docker start critmux ; docker attach critmux``. MIND. BLOWN.

Note: ``docker start -a`` doesn't quite work.

## What the?

This container starts a little wrapper, which sets up a ``SIGTERM``
signal handler. Then it checks if there is some saved state in
``/state``:

- if there is no saved state, we assume a clean start, setup a
  ``tmux`` session, and attach to it;
- if there is a saved state, it is restored it (it should be a tmux
  daemon process), then we attach to tmux.

The signal handler just sends a detach command to tmux; and the
wrapper arranges for the state to be saved when tmux is detached.
In other words, when detaching from tmux, or when sending ``SIGTERM``,
or when doing ``docker stop`` on the container, we end up saving its
state.

## Requirements

You need a fairly recent kernel. Debian's 3.14 works; some people
reported that 3.13 didn't.

AUFS won't work.
