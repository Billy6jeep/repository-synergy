Research papers
---------------

If you are interested in learning more about Zoe and the underling scheduling theory, we published a paper with an experimental evaluation that show the advantages of our techniques.

The paper can be found on open access `at ArXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09528>`_.
