# ADI Interview Workshop Problems and Solutions

## Overview

The problems are divided into easy, medium, and hard.  Inside each file I have
noted the prerequesites for being able to answer the question easily, along
with tags.

For now all the solutions I've given are in Python/pseudocode (my excuse if
code doesn't actually run).  Feel free to add solutions in other languages. Also,
the way this is set up is ideal for mock interviewers (helpful tags, solutions
and hints), let me know if there are any ways you can think of to make this
more helpful to people practicing.

## Contributing

Please free to add notes to questions, improve solutions, and add more questions.
Please don't add questions that you've heard in actual interviews unless you're
sure that it is compliant with the company's policies.  Thanks a lot, and hope
this is useful.
