OVERVIEW

  MASTIFF is a static analysis framework that automates the process of
  extracting key characteristics from a number of different file
  formats.  To ensure the framework remains flexible and extensible, a
  community-driven set of plug-ins is used to perform file analysis
  and data extraction.  While originally designed to support malware,
  intrusion, and forensic analysis, the framework is well-suited to
  support a broader range of analytic needs.  In a nutshell, MASTIFF
  allows analysts to focus on analysis rather than figuring out how to
  parse files.

  The MASTIFF Project is hosted at:

  General documentation is located in the docs directory.  See the
