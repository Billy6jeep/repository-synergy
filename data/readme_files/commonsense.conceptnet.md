ConceptNet
==========

ConceptNet aims to give computers access to common-sense knowledge, the kind of information that ordinary
people know but usually leave unstated.

The new version of ConceptNet, **ConceptNet 5**, is now maintained in a separate repository:

http://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/

See http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu for more information.
