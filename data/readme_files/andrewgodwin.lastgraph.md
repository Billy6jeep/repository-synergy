# LastGraph

This is the LastGraph codebase. It's placed here purely for posterity - the code is pretty terrible (and from 2007),
and just barely ported to modern Django, so please don't use it as an example or somewhere to crib code ideas from.

## Installation

Make a virtualenv, install requirements.txt into it, and have some hope. Make sure your system has Cairo installed with
its python bindings too - that's python-cairo on Ubuntu/Debian.

## Support

There is none. This code is static and unsupported; I will not take pull requests or change it. It's purely archival.

## License

This code is released under the BSD license. A copy is available as the file LICENSE in this repo.
