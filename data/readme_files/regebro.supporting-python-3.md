Supporting Python 3
===================

.. image:: https://api.travis-ci.org/regebro/supporting-python-3.png

This is a free book about how to make your code support Python 3.

It costs nothing, and you can both publish it and contribute to it!


Reading this book
-----------------

Supporting Python 3 is available for free on http://python3porting.com/ . You
can also download a PDF version from https://gumroad.com/l/python3 for any
price you like, and you can buy a paper version from
https://www.createspace.com/4312357 for $4.45, which is the printing cost of
the book, and hence as close to free as you can possibly come.

As of today, the name of the book in all these places are "Porting to Python
3", which is the old name of the book before I made it into a community
effort. This will change sometime during 2015, and the above links will also
change as a result.

Generating the PDFs
-------------------

Making a PDF is not just a matter of doing ``make pdf``. Doing so will indeed
create a PDF, but you need to create four PDF's when releasing the book.

You need::

* A print PDF, 6" x 9", black only.
* A screen PDF, 8.27" x 11", with syntax highlighting.
* A tablet PDF, 7" x 9", with syntax highlighting.
* A phone PDF, 4.8" x 7.2", with syntax highlighting.

You do this by changing the conf.py. For the print PDF, the ``pygments_style``
should be ``"none"`` otherwise it should be ``"sphinx"``.

To select the paper size, change the used variable in ``print_latex_elements``
between ``print_form``, ``screen_form``, ``tablets_form`` or ``phone_form``.

You don't need to do anything more for the Print PDF, it's done, but the
other PDF's should have the front and back covers merged. This can be done
with tools like pdfunite::

    $ pdfunite covers/PhoneFront.pdf build/latex/SupportingPython3.pdf \
        covers/PhoneBack.pdf SupportingPython3-phone-1.0-dev.pdf

An additional hitch is that each release of Sphinx or texlive will have
changes that break the PDF generation, so it's highly unlikely that this book
will generate cleanly on your computer. It works on Ubuntu 14.04LTS, but not
on Ubuntu 16.04, for example.

You have to install at least the following packages to build the book::

  ``texlive texlive-xetex texlive-latex-extra lmodern fonts-texgyre
    fonts-linuxlibertine python-sphinx poppler-utils``

EPUB Generation
---------------
It is also possible to make an EPUB format of this book with the command 
``make epub`` - note that at the current time this will lack the front and 
back covers.

The resulting eBook, in EPUB format, will be placed in the file 
``build/epub/SupportingPython3.epub`` _or it's windows equivalent.

HTML Generation
---------------
It is also possible to make both standalone HTML and HTML directory, 
(directories with ``index.html`` starting points), formats of this book
with the commands ``make html`` and ``make dirhtml`` - note that at the
current time these will lack the front and back covers.

The resulting books will be placed in the directories 
``build/html`` and ``build/dirhtml`` respectively.
