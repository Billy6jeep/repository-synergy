Diff, Match and Patch Library

Neil Fraser

This library is currently available in seven different ports, all using the same API.
Every version includes a full set of unit tests.

API地址(https://github.com/bystep15/google-diff-match-patch/tree/wiki)

C++:
* Ported by Mike Slemmer.
* Currently requires the Qt library.

C#:
* Ported by Matthaeus G. Chajdas.

Dart:
* The Dart language is still growing and evolving, so this port is only as
  stable as the underlying language.

Java:
* Included is both the source and a Maven package.

JavaScript:
* diff_match_patch_uncompressed.js is the human-readable version.
  Users of node.js should 'require' this uncompressed version since the
  compressed version is not guaranteed to work outside of a web browser.
* diff_match_patch.js has been compressed using Google's internal JavaScript compressor.
  Non-Google hackers who wish to recompress the source can use:

Lua:
* Ported by Duncan Cross.
* Does not support line-mode speedup.

Objective C:
* Ported by Jan Weiss.
* Includes speed test (this is a separate bundle for other languages).

Python:
* Two versions, one for Python 2.x, the other for Python 3.x.
* Runs 10x faster under PyPy than CPython.

Demos:
* Separate demos for Diff, Match and Patch in JavaScript.


The Diff Match and Patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform the operations required for synchronizing plain text.

### Diff
* Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of differences.
* [Diff Demo](http://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/svn/trunk/demos/demo_diff.html)

### Match
* Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of plain text.  Weighted for both accuracy and location.
* [Match Demo](http://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/svn/trunk/demos/demo_match.html)

### Patch
* Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply patch even when the underlying text doesn&#x27;t match.
* [Patch Demo](http://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/svn/trunk/demos/demo_patch.html)

Currently available in Java, JavaScript, Dart, C++, C#, Objective C, Lua and Python. Regardless of language, each library features [the same API](https://github.com/bystep15/google-diff-match-patch/blob/wiki/API.md) and the same functionality. All versions also have comprehensive test harnesses.

### Algorithms

This library implements [Myer&#x27;s diff algorithm](http://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/myers.pdf) which is generally considered to be the best general-purpose diff. A layer of [pre-diff speedups and post-diff cleanups](http://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/) surround the diff algorithm, improving both performance and output quality.

This library also implements a [Bitap matching algorithm](http://neil.fraser.name/software/diff_match_patch/bitap.ps) at the heart of a flexible [matching and patching strategy](http://neil.fraser.name/writing/patch/).
