- [x] **WGAN** from 'Wasserstein GAN' (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)
- [x] **BEGAN** from 'BEGAN: Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks' (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10717)
- [x] **MAD-GAN** from 'Multi-Agent Diverse Generative Adversarial Networks' (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02906)
- [x] **GoGAN** from 'Gang of GANs: Generative Adversarial Networks with Maximum Margin Ranking' (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04865)
- [ ] ... (To be added)

- Done without any hyper-parameter search.
- MAD-GAN worked best in the tested datasets.
