OpenBlock is a web application and RESTful service that allows users
to browse and search their local area for "hyper-local news" - to see
what's going on recently in the immediate geographic area.

About the Project
=================

OpenBlock began life as the open-source code released by
Everyblock.com in June 2009.  Originally created by Adrian Holovaty
and the Everyblock team, it was further developed as an open-source (GPL)
project by OpenPlans from 2010-2011.

Funding for the initial creation of Everyblock and OpenPlans' work on the
development of OpenBlock was provided by the Knight Foundation
(http://www.knightfoundation.org/).
