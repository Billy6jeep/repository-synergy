# Predictions balancing script

A script for balancing predictions which helps in achieving high results on Kaggle

Usage:

`python run.py input_path output_path` where input_path is a path to a torch tensor of shape (num_samples, num_classes)

This algorithm was used in Kaggle competitions:

* Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition

* IEEE's Signal Processing Society - Camera Model Identification https://www.kaggle.com/c/sp-society-camera-model-identification
