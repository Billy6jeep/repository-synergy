# tradingWithPython

This library contains code that is (re)usable in in daily tasks involving development of quantitative trading strategies.
It is used as my personal toobox as well as boiler-plate code for the [tradingWithPython](http://www.tradingwithpython.com)
course.

Some parts of the library are [documented ](http://sjev.github.io/trading-with-python) , for others you can either read the code or take the course ;-)
