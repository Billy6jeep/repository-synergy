[[back to top](#about-this-repository)]

During my work and hobbies, I started accumulating useful material about different topics in Protein-Science, which I wanted to collect in a central place and share with others in hope that it might serve as a useful reference one day.

### Substructure Alignment Using OpenEye OEChem RMSD
[[back to top](#about-this-repository)]

![steroid substructure](./tutorials/substructure_alignment/Images/reference_substructure.png)

A how-to for extracting a substructure from a molecule and use it as query for an alignment to target molecules.

### Low-Energy Conformer Generation and Overlay
[[back to top](#about-this-repository)]

![low-energy overlay](./tutorials/low_energy_conformer_overlay/Images/ZINC_00062008_confs_2_small.png)

Tutorial and script to generate low-energy conformers of query and target molecules and overlay them to choose the highest-scoring hit using OpenEye software.

### Molecular docking, estimating free energies of binding, and AutoDock's semi-empirical force field

[[back to top](#about-this-repository)]

![](./tutorials/scoring_functions_and_autodock/Images/prot_lig_complexes.png)

Discussions and questions about methods, approaches, and tools for estimating (relative) free binding energies of protein-ligand complexes are quite popular, and even the simplest tools can be quite tricky to use. Here, I want to briefly summarize the idea of molecular docking, and give a short overview about how we can use AutoDock 4.2's hybrid approach for evaluating binding affinities.

# Scripts and Tools
[[back to top](#about-this-repository)]

- A useful [one-liner cheatsheet](./scripts-and-tools/oneliner.md) for quick and simple commands for working with protein structure files.

- the **[`scripts-and-tools`](./scripts-and-tools)** subdirectory with tools for, e.g., 
	- [`center_of_mass.py`](./scripts-and-tools/center_of_mass) - calculating the center of mass of protein and ligands 
	- [`pdb_to_fasta.py`](./scripts-and-tools/pdb_to_fasta) - converting PDB files into FASTA strings
	- [`rmsd.py`](./scripts-and-tools/rmsd) - calculating the RMSD between two molecules
	- [`grab_atom_radius.py`](./scripts-and-tools/grab_atom_radius) - extracting coordinates from PDB files 
	- [`renumber_pdb.py`](./scripts-and-tools/renumber_pdb) - renumbering atoms and residues in PDB files
	- [`split_multimol2.py`](./scripts-and-tools/split_multimol2) - splitting a multi-MOL2 file into individual MOL2 files
	- [`strip_h.py`](./scripts-and-tools/strip_h) - stripping Hydrogen atoms for single PDB files or nested directories of PDB files


- **[smilite](https://github.com/rasbt/smilite)** - a Python module to download and analyze SMILE strings (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-entry System) of chemical compounds from ZINC

- **[pyprot](https://github.com/rasbt/pyprot)** - a Python package for working with protein structure files formats. It comes with a collection of ready-to-use scripts for the most common file operations and protein analyses.


- **[PDB Info Table](https://github.com/rasbt/datacollect/tree/master/pdb_infotable)** - A simple command line tool that creates an info table from a list of PDB files.
