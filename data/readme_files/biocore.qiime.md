QIIME: Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology
===================================================

**[QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) has succeeded QIIME 1 as of January 1, 2018.** QIIME 1 is no longer officially supported, as our development and support efforts are now focused entirely on QIIME 2. For more information about what this means, see our blog post: [QIIME 2 has succeeded QIIME 1](https://qiime.wordpress.com/2018/01/03/qiime-2-has-succeeded-qiime-1/).

QIIME 1 users should transition from QIIME 1 to QIIME 2. If you're new to QIIME, you should start by learning QIIME 2, not QIIME 1.

The QIIME 1 website can be found at http://www.qiime.org. For related software projects and data, see [biocore](http://biocore.github.io).
