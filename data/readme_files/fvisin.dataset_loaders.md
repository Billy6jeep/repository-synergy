This repository contains a framework to load the most commonly used datasets
for image and video semantic segmentation. The framework can perform some
on-the-fly preprocessing/data augmentation, as well as run on multiple threads
(if enabled) to speed up the I/O operations.

**NEWS:** You might be interested in checking out 
[Main loop TF](https://github.com/fvisin/main_loop_tf), a python main loop that integrates the *Dataset loaders* with Tensorflow!
