Recipes
=========

This is a collection of recipes for using [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne). Code snippets, IPython notebooks, tutorials and useful extensions are welcome here.

! Please note - the AWS S3 bucket used in many of these examples has been made [Requester Pays](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html). Direct links or downloading with `wget` will no longer work, but you can still download these files using [`aws cli`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) or a client such as [S3 Browser](http://s3browser.com/).

Organization
------------

* Examples: short examples demonstrating how to accomplish something interesting with Lasagne.
* Tutorials: longer examples covering a range of topics.
* Papers: code implementing a new technique or replicating results of a specific paper.
* Model Zoo: a collection of pretrained models.
* Utils: helper functions which can be imported.
* Stale: things that break due to api changes will live here until they can be updated. Hopefully empty.
