Bash Utils (miscellaneous small utils for the Bash shell)
=========================================================

**New (Jan 9, 2017)!** All scripts were updated to Python 3. The original Python 2 version (which is not maintained anymore) is tagged as "v0.1". You can find that
under the "release" link.

Here I collect some small command-line utils.
