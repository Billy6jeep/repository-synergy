## Requirements

- Linux, macOS, Windows (Windows requires Docker)
- Python 2.7 or 3 with `pip` and `virtualenv` or Conda
- TensorFlow

## Install Guild AI

To install Guild AI with pip, run:

``` bash
pip install guildai
```

If you already have Guild AI installed, you can upgrade it to the
latest release using:

``` bash
pip install guildai --upgrade
```

To install pre-release versions (e.g. you want the latest features or
fixes), include the `--pre` command line option:

```
pip install guildai --upgrade --pre
```

NOTE: You may need to run `pip` as a privileged user (e.g. run using
`sudo`) or else specify the `--user` command line option if you file
permission errors when running `pip install`.

Ensure that you have [TensorFlow
installed](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).

NOTE: As of Guild 0.6, all major computational and ML frameworks are
supported including PyTorch, Keras, MLKit, scikit-learn, and
XGBoost. TensorFlow is required for TensorBoard integration. **Your
models do not have to use TensorFlow to work with Guild AI**. The
TensorFlow requirement will be removed in future releases of Guild.

For detailed install instructions, see [Install Guild
AI](https://www.guild.ai/install).

## Quick Start

In this Quick Start guide, we create a mock training script and run it
to illustrate the following features:

- Run, capture and compare experiments
- Use grid search and random search to explore hyperparameter space
- Use Bayesian optimization to achieve the best performance

Links to more advanced topics are provided at the end of this section.

### Mock training script

In a new project directory, create a file named `train.py`:

``` python
import numpy as np

x = 0.1
noise = 0.1

loss = (np.sin(5 * x) * (1 - np.tanh(x ** 2)) + np.random.randn() * noise)

print("x: %f" % x)
print("noise: %f" % noise)
print("loss: %f" % loss)
```

NOTE: This is a *mock (fake) training script* — it doesn't train
anything! However, it illustrates the basics of training, where an
operation is used to minimize loss given a set of inputs. In this
example, we calculate loss using a noisy function and a single input
*x*, which represents our hyperparameter.

### Run an experiment

Open a command console and change to the project directory.

Use Guild to run the mock training script:

```
guild run train.py
```

Guild prompts you with the default values as defined in
`train.py`. Press `Enter` to run the script.

NOTE: Guild automatically detects the flags defined in `train.py` and
uses the default values. Later we run `train.py` with different values
for `x` and even use Guild to find values that minimize the function
loss.

When Guild runs a script, it captures the run as a unique
experiment. You can list runs by running:

```
guild runs
```

View information for this run using:

```
guild runs info
```

By default, Guild shows information for the latest run.

NOTE: For information on any Guild command, use: `guild COMMAND
--help`. For a list of commands, use `guild --help`. Online help is
available at
[https://guild.ai/docs/commands/](https://guild.ai/docs/commands/).

Experiments are saved on disk within file system directories. List
files associated with the latest run using:

```
guild ls
```

In the case of our mock training script, the files list is empty
because the script doesn't generate any files. However, you can see
the path where the run is located.

Guild stores information associated with each run in files located in
the `.guild` subdirectory of each run. You can list all of the files
associated with the latest run, including Guild files, by specifying
the `--all` command line option:

```
guild ls --all
```

If you want to export an experiment, use the `export` command:

```
guild export /tmp/my-experiments
```

This is useful for creating archives of runs that can be imported by
you and others using the `import` command. For a more advanced example
of backing runs up to the cloud, see [Get Started - Backup and
Restore](https://guild.ai/docs/start/backup-restore/).

You can list runs located in an archive directory by specifying the
`--archive` command line option:

```
guild runs --archive /tmp/my-experiments
```

### Run a second experiment

In the command console, run:

```
guild run train.py x=0.2
```

Press `Enter` to confirm the operation.

Guild runs `train.py` a second time using a new value for `x`.

Compare the two runs using `compare`:

```
guild compare
```

Guild Compare is spreadsheet-like application that lets you view
experiment results. Use the cursor keys to navigate to various
columns. Sort a column in ascending order by press `1` and in
descending order by pressing `2`. Press `?` to view a list of key
bindings for Guild Compare.

When you're done comparing the runs, press `q` to return to the
command prompt.

### Run multiple trials using grid and random search

Guild supports running multiple trials using various methods.

First, use Guild to run three trials over a discrete search space for
`x` (i.e. a *grid search*, or *parameter sweep*) run:

```
guild run train.py x=[-2.0,0.0,2.0]
```

Press `Enter` to confirm. Guild generates three trials, one for each
specified value of `x`.

Next, run three trials using *random search* over a uniform
distribution of `x`:

```
guild run train.py x=uniform[-1.0:1.0] --max-trials 3
```

Press `Enter` to run the trials. Guild generates another three trials,
according to the command line option `--max-trials`.

Compare the runs again:

```
guild compare --table
```

This time we use the `--table` command line option for `compare`. This
tells Guild to print the results as a table rather than run
interactively.

Sort the results by `loss` in ascending order by running:

```
guild compare --table --min loss
```

Limit the results to the top three results (i.e. the three results
with the lowest *loss*) by using the `--top` option:

```
guild compare --table --min loss --top 3
```

### Optimize loss using Bayesian methods

As you can see from the previous sections, Guild specializes in
running, capturing, and comparing experiments. In this section, we
demonstrate how this facility can be further used to *optimize*
hyperparameters.

Let's try to find values for `x` that minimize `loss`. Because our
mock training script is noisy (to simulate machine learning processes
that are inherently noisy) we cannot find a single value for `x` where
`loss` is always lowest. Nonetheless, we can find a range of values
that tend to produce better results.

In the command console, run:

```
guild run train.py x=uniform[-2.0:2.0] --optimizer bayesian --max-trials 20
```

Press `Enter` to continue. Guild runs 20 trials, trying values for `x`
with the goal of minimizing `loss`. By default, Guild uses a Bayesian
method with Gaussian processes to explore values for `x` that have a
higher likelihood of producing lower values of `loss`. You can specify
other optimizers including `forest` (decision trees) and `ggbrt`
(gradient boosted trees).

NOTE: Guild's built-in Bayesian optimization support is implemented
using the excellent [skopt
library](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/). In future releases,
Guild will support additional optimization libraries, including
optimizers you define yourself.

For more information on using Bayesian optimizers in Guild, see [Get
Started - Bayesian Optimization
](https://guild.ai/docs/start/optimization/#bayesian-optimization).

Compare all of the runs:

```
guild compare
```

In this case we run `compare` in interactive mode. To quickly find
runs with the lowest loss, use the cursor keys to navigate to the
`loss` column and press `1` to sort in ascending order.

Values for `x` that are close to `-0.3` should be listed toward the
top.

The function defined in `train.py` (again, a mock function used for
illustration purposes — it doesn't actually train anything) can be
used to plot the relationship between `x` and `loss`:

![](https://guild.ai/assets/img/bayesian-optimization.png)

We indeed see that loss is lowest where `x` is around `-0.3`.

Press `q` to exit Guild Compare.

### Clean up

If you want to delete a run, use:

```
guild runs rm RUN_ID_OR_INDEX
```

You can get the `RUN_ID` using `guild runs`. You can also specify a
run `INDEX`, which is included in the runs list.

To delete all runs, use:

```
guild runs rm
```

You can restore deleted runs using the `restore` command.
