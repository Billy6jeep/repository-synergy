========
A Python package for epidemiology. Epipy is a Python package for epidemiology.
It contains tools for analyzing and visualizing epidemiology data.
Epipy can currently produce:

* stratified summary statistics

* epicurves
* analysis of case attribute (e.g. sex) by generation
* 2x2 tables with odds ratio and relative risk
* summary of cluster basic reproduction numbers

Installation
------------
The github version of epipy is substantially further along that the pip version. I suggest installing from this repo when possible.

Install using pip:

    pip install epipy
    
Or clone the repository and install using setup.py:

    git clone https://github.com/cmrivers/epipy.git
    cd ./epipy
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install

EpiPy is in development. Please feel free to contribute.
