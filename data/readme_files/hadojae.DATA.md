*PINCHERSOFPERIL and BULLYBUSTER are WIP

DATA scripts are a constant work in progress. Feedback, issues, and additions are welcomed.

Proper python packages will be created once suffecient testing and features have been added and more bugs have been squashed.

### Troubleshooting

Make sure you are using the latest versions of Firefox, Selenium, and Mechanize. Selenium and Mechanize can be upgraded via pip. 

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firefox
sudo pip install mechanize --upgrade
sudo pip install selenium --upgrade
```

The current version of geckodriver tested is v0.19.1.

If you have pcap writing issues, use this to fixup dumpcap perms, observed when using some VPS
```
sudo chgrp YOUR_USER /usr/bin/dumpcap
sudo chmod 750 /usr/bin/dumpcap
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip /usr/bin/dumpcap
```

Be sure to disable NIC features when capturing traffic run this as root. Checksum errors will cause all sorts of nightmares.
```
# for i in rx tx sg tso ufo gso gro lro; do ethtool -K eth0 $i off; done
```
