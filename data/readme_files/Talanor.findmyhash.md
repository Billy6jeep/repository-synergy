# hash-tool.py

hash-tool.py tries to crack different types of hashes using free online services.

NOTE: hash-tool.py 2.0 is coming!! The new version will have many changes and improvements. Some of these changes are:

### Usage
The help is pretty self-explanatory and as the API will change quite a bit in the next days / weeks / years, I will not describe the usage further.

```
python3 hash-tool.py --help
```

### Dependencies

A dependencies.txt is available, use it.

In order to work properly, some of the services use selenium with chrome headless' driver. This might be removed / added as an option or disregarded during four years, who knows? But as of right now, best to install those.
