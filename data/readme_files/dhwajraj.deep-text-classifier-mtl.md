It is a tensorflow implementation using MULTI-TASK LEARNING for Kim's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) paper in Tensorflow.

Core methods are derived from [dennybritz implementation](https://github.com/dennybritz/cnn-text-classification-tf)
The major refactoring has been done to incorporate the following:
 - Loading pre-trained word embeddings
 - Loading tab separated training text (format : label<tab>text<newline>)
 - Training multiple different binary classification tasks at once (Multi-Task Learning - alternative)

## Multi-Task Learning

In multi-task alternative training, same model is alternatively trained to perform multiple binary classification tasks in the same language.

Multi-task training can exploit the fact that different sequence tagging tasks in one language share language-specific regularities. The basic idea is to share part of the architecture and parameters between tasks, and to alternatively train multiple objective functions with respect to different tasks. Tensorflow automatically figures out which calculations are needed for the operation you requested, and only conducts those calculations. This means that if we define an optimiser on only one of the tasks, it will only train the parameters required to compute that task - and will leave the rest alone. Since Task 1 relies only on the Task 1 and Shared Layers, the Task 2 layer will be untouched. Letâ€™s draw another diagram with the desired optimisers at the end of each task.
