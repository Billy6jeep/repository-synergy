## Better Versions

Unfortunately I don't get time to add unit tests or improve on this
anymore (as I don't use it much if at all) but there are other forks of
fysom that you should definitely check out:

 * [Maximilien Riehl's](https://github.com/mriehl/fysom) smoothened fork
   with 100% test coverage and install scripts. He's also made it
   available through PyPi (easily installable using
   `pip install fysom`).

 * [Bartosz Ptaszynski's](https://github.com/foobarto/fysom) beefed up
   version with per event+state callbacks and multiple destination event
   choices.

## Other ports

Below is the list of other ports of this library:

 * [Jake Gordon's](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine)
   original version which this is a port of.

 * [Max Persson's](https://github.com/looplab/fsm) port to
   [Go](http://golang.org/).

## Usage
