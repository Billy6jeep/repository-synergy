## About Videocache

[VideoCache](http://cachevideos.com/) is a [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) URL rewriter plugin written in Python for bandwidth optimization while browsing famous video portals. It helps you save bandwidth when a particular video is requested more than once from the same network/machine.

Squid can not cache the dynamically served videos. VideoCache fits into squid to help it cache the videos as well. The cached videos are stored on your proxy serverâ€™s local storage or on a storage server in your network. These cached videos can be served to your clients at a very fast speed saving you significant upstream bandwidth.
