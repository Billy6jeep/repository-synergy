Pebl is a python library and command line application for learning the structure of a Bayesian network given prior knowledge and observations. Pebl includes the following features:

  * Can learn with observational and interventional data
  * Handles missing values and hidden variables using exact and heuristic methods
  * Provides several learning algorithms; makes creating new ones simple
  * Has facilities for transparent parallel execution using several cluster and cloud resources
  * Calculates edge marginals and consensus networks
  * Presents results in a variety of formats

Pebl has been developed at the Systems Biology Lab at the University of Michigan and in available under a [permissive MIT-style license](http://github.com/abhik/pebl/raw/master/LICENSE.txt).
