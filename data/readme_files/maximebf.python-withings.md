and consumer secret from Withings by creating an application

Usage:

``` python
from withings import WithingsAuth, WithingsApi
from settings import CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET

auth = WithingsAuth(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)
authorize_url = auth.get_authorize_url()
print "Go to %s allow the app and copy your oauth_verifier" % authorize_url

oauth_verifier = raw_input('Please enter your oauth_verifier: ')
creds = auth.get_credentials(oauth_verifier)
