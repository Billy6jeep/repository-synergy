# Preamble
 
~Firstly read [this](https://github.com/WhitewidowScanner/whitewidow/issues/82) if you want Whitewidow development to continue.~
 
Hello all you whitewidow fans out there (I say that with good intentions I promise!). It's me Ekultek, I'm just here to give you a little inside on what's going on with the whitewidow development team and what's happening with it. Well, to put it bluntly, we will not be continuing the development of whitewidow, the development has been drafted to a different language under a different name. Let me introduce [Zeus](https://github.com/ekultek/zeus-scanner). 

Zeus is whitewidow's big brother, it is capable of all the same things whitewidow is capable of, but with more twists and turns in it. Zeus will bypass the API calling, IP blocking, and captchas that whitewidow cannot get passed. Zeus can run SQLi checks with sqlmap, port scans with NMAP, XSS scans with a built in XSS scanner, admin page finding, along with a couple other cool tricks. 

I understand your probably a little dissapointed. This project has been around for over a year now, and you guys have made it possible for me to continue on something better. Of course, you can still use whitewidow! The repository will always be here, I just won't be fixing anything nor pushing new updates to it. 

If you want to you can update it, it's up to you guys now! Finally without further ado, here is [Zeus](https://github.com/ekultek/zeus-scanner) enjoy it, and thank you to all of you for giving me the motivation to continue with things. Without you, this wouldn't exist. Hope you enjoy Zeus.

# Whitewidow
Whitewidow is an open source automated SQL vulnerability scanner, that is capable of running through a file list, or can
scrape Google for potential vulnerable websites. It allows automatic file formatting, random user agents, IP addresses, server information, multiple SQL injection syntax, ability to launch sqlmap from the program, and a fun environment. This program was created for learning purposes, and is intended to teach users what vulnerability looks like.

# Screenshots
Launching whitewidow displays the custom designed banner and begins searching for possible sites that could be vulnerable

Whitewidow is capable of finding vulnerabilities in websites by scraping Google using over 1,000 different queries that are carefully researched before added. It also uses multiple different SQL injection approaches

Whitewidow is also capable of spidering a single webpage for all available links, it will then search for vulnerabilities in all the links using the programs built in file feature

And when all is said and done, and you're sure that you've found some vulnerable sites, you can launch sqlmap from the program without the need of downloading another clone.

# Download
Preferably clone repository, alternatively you can download zip and tarball [here](https://github.com/Ekultek/whitewidow/releases/tag/2.0)

# Basic Usage
`ruby whitewidow.rb -d` This will run whitewidow in default mode and scrape Google for possible sites using a random search query.

`ruby whitewidow.rb -f path/to/file` This will run whitewidow through a given file and add the SQL syntax to the URL.

`ruby whitewidow.rb -h` Will run the help flag along with show the help menu.

For more information about usage and more flags you can checkout the wiki functionality page [here](https://github.com/Ekultek/whitewidow/wiki/Functionality).

# Dependencies
 - `gem 'mechanize'`
 - `gem 'nokogiri'`
 - `gem 'rest-client'`
 - `gem 'webmock'`
 - `gem 'rspec'`
 - `gem 'vcr'`

To install all gem dependencies, follow the following template:
