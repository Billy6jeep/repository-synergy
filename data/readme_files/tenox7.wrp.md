# WRP - Web Rendering Proxy

A browser-in-browser "proxy" server that allows to use historical / vintage web browsers on the modern web. It works by rendering a web page in to a GIF or PNG image with clickable imagemap.

## Usage

1. [Download a WRP binary](https://github.com/tenox7/wrp/releases/) and run it on a machine that will become your WRP gateway/server.
2. Point your legacy browser to `http://address:port` of WRP server. Do not set or use it as a "http proxy server".
3. Type a search string or a http/https URL and click **Go**.
4. Adjust your screen width/height/scale/#colors to fit in your old browser.
5. Scroll web page by clicking on the in-image scroll bar.
6. Do not use client browser history-back, instead use **Bk** button in the app.
7. To send keystrokes, fill **K** input box and press **Go**. There also are buttons for backspace, enter and arrow keys.
8. You can set height **H** to `0` to render pages in to one tall image without the vertical scrollbar. This feature is experimental and your mileage will vary depending ong many factors.
9. Prefer PNG over GIF if your browser supports it. PNG is much faster, whereas GIF requires a lot of additional processing on both client and server.

## Docker

docker hub:

```shell
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 tenox7/wrp
```

gcr.io:

```shell
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/tenox7/wrp:latest
```

## Flags

```flags
-l  listen address:port, default :8080
-t  image type gif (default) or png, when using PNG number of colors is ignored
-g  image geometry, WxHXC, height can be 0 for unlimited, default 1152x600x256
-h  headed mode, display browser window on the server
-d  chromedp debug logging
-n  do not free maps and gif images after use
```

## Minimal Requirements

* Server Gateway should run on a modern hardware/os that supports memory hungry Chrome.
* Client Browser needs to support `HTML FORMs` and `ISMAP`. Typically Mosaic 2.0 would be minimum version for forms. However ISMAP was supported since 0.6B, so if you manually enter url using `?url=...`, you can use the earlier version.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't get it to open

This program does not have a GUI and is run from the command line. You may need to enable executable mode, for example on Mac:

```bash
$ cd ~/your-download-directory
$ chmod +x wrp-amd64-macos
$ ./wrp-amd64-macos -t png
```

## History

* In 2014, version 1.0 started as a *cgi-bin* script, adaptation of `webkit2png.py` and `pcidade.py`, [blog post](https://virtuallyfun.com/2014/03/03/surfing-modern-web-with-ancient-browsers/).
* Later in 2014, version 2.0 became a stand alone http-proxy server, also support for both Linux/MacOS, [another post](https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2014/03/11/web-rendering-proxy-update//).
* In 2016 the whole internet migrated to HTTPS/SSL/TLS and WRP largely stopped working. Python code became unmaintainable and mostly unportable (especially to Windows, even WSL).
* In 2019 WRP 3.0 has been rewritten in Golang/Chromedp as browser-in-browser instead of http proxy.
* Later in 2019, WRP 4.0 has been completely refactored to use mouse clicks instead using a href nodes. Also in 4.1 added sending keystrokes in to input boxes. You can now login to Gmail. Also now runs as a Docker container. Version 4.5 introduces rendering whole pages in to one tall image image.
