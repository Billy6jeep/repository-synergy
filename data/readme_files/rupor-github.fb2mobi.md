This program is based on fb2conv program published by [dnkorpushov](https://github.com/dnkorpushov) on [the-ebook.org](http://www.the-ebook.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=28447) site.

## Important:
**This project has been "stable" for a while - no changes or additional fixes were requested for a long time. Builds for Linux and Windows build environments have been fully
defined in the docker files and build process fully automated in scripts. At the same time maintaining Python build environment
for several platforms (as well as attemptng to fix various problems with Unicode support in Python for Windows) has been noticeable burden for me - requiring
time and resources (which I do not have). As the result I am reducing my attention to this project - there would not be conversion
to latest Python or any further program binary distributions for Windows and Linux coming from me. I may be able to provide source level fixes, but
this would be it.**

**Instead I am opening new project - [fb2converter](https://github.com/rupor-github/fb2converter), a complete rewrite of this program in go language which
requires much less support time (or so I think). At the moment it has everything command line of fb2mobi does and then some and eventually it may even get
its own UI, we'll see. Any new features or significant fixes would be provided by new project or would have to come from somebody else.**

Original program (being Python 2) did not work well under Windows when non-russian system codepage was selected for non-Unicode programs.
In order to improve the situation I had to port it to Python 3. Later author of original converter re-joined the project and ported GUI UI here.
He also added binary releases for MAC.

Here is brief list of changes to the original project (in addition to bug fixes):

* All messages and profile descriptions got translated to English
* Fixed all problems I was aware of at the moment (see git log)
* Added ability to apply xslt transformation from external file to fb2 before further processing (`--xslt` key or `<xslt>` config tag)
* Added xslt extension "katz_tr" to speedup and simplify transformation of direct speech in dialogs
* Added smart dropcaps processing (`--dropcaps=Smart` key or `<dropcaps>Smart</dropcaps>` config tag)
* Added some rudimentary epub processing (like title rewriting based on calibre metadata and hyphenation)
* Switched hyphenator to hyphen which uses properly maintained dictionaries from LibreOffice, so now many languages are supported and you could add more
* Added support for "floating" footnotes (`--notes-mode=float` key or `<notesMode>float</notesMode>` config tag)
* Added support for MOBI post-processing and optimization
* Added cover and thumbnail image optimization
* Made cover size user configurable (`--screen-width`, `--screen-height` or `<screenWidth>`, `<screenHeight>`)
* Added support for latest Kidle firmware (>= 5.7.2)
* Added simple tool to generate thumbnails on Kindle devices
* Added synchronous logging to file and console (console logging level is set independently by `--console-level` key or `<consoleLevel>` config tag)
* Added an option to make PNG images non-transparent to prevent "ghostly images" on Kindle (`--remove-png-transparency` key or `<removePngTransparency>` config tag)
* Added support for auto-generation of PageMaps - now it is possible to have APNX files (`--apnx=eInk|PC` key or `<generateAPNX>` profile tag). Number of uncompessed
  text characters per page is (approximately) controlled by `charactersPerPage` profile tag and by default is equal to 2300 (Calibre default setting)
* Removed `<flatTOC>` support. New config tag `<tocType>` and command line parameter `--toc-type` could be used instead with values `Flat|Kindle|Normal`.
  This introduces special support for eInk Kindle devices with 2-level TOC views. Additional tag `<tocKindleLevel>` and parameter `--toc-kindle-level` allow for precise
  tuning of generated NCX for eInk devices.
* Expanded book title generation: added `#padnumber` to generate number in series padded with zeros (use `<seriesPositions>` or `--series-positions` to specify how many
  digits overall will be generated) and `#date` to add proper date from `<title-info>` if availabe.
* Added new `<chapterLevel>` configuration tag and `---chapter-level` parameter along with new style `.titleblock_nobreak`. When parsing sections this style will be generated
  if nesting level is greater or equal to specified value. This allows better control of page breaks on sections boundaries.
* Supported `<openBookFromCover>` configuration tag and `---open-book-from-cover` parameter for compatibility with fb2conv. Works for `epub` output only.
* Changed how book title and book author are formatted - added processing of conditional blocks, for example: `<bookTitleFormat>{(#abbrseries{ #padnumber}) }#title</bookTitleFormat>`. To output curly braces escape them with backslash.
* Added new css style `.linkanchor` - this is style for all href links which are NOT pointing to the note bodies. This allows for flexible formatting of hyperlinks in the text.
* Added "default" cover for fb2 which do not have it (APG 2018.1) - `<coverDefault>` in profile configuration.
* Added image re-sampling - `<scaleImages>` in profile configuration or `--scale-images` on command line (Should be positive non-zero float number, cover image is exempt from this). DPI is preserved.
* Added `--config` parameter and changed the way program looks for configuration file. Now, unless --config is provided files in user HOME directory have precedence over distribution files.
* For FB2 input files output name could be derived from book metadata using tag `<outputPattern>` and the same rules as for book title.
* Added support for multiple authors

Program uses source code (modified) from following projects released under GPL:

* [KindleUnpack](https://github.com/kevinhendricks/KindleUnpack)
* [Image Utils](https://gist.github.com/drcongo/8521040)

In order to build [releases](https://github.com/rupor-github/fb2mobi/releases) we are using Python 3.6.5 with [following modules](https://github.com/rupor-github/fb2mobi/blob/master/requirements.txt).

If you are not using "frozen" distribution you would need to download [Amazon's KindleGen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211).

Enjoy!
