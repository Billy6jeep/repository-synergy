# writeups

Writeups for CTFs by the team [ByteBandits](https://ctftime.org/team/13691)

All writeups are organized in the pattern:

ctf-name > problem-type > problem-name > author

That is, very similar to that of the repo [writeups](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2015)

The repository also includes a small [search tool](search.py), through we can we can easily find writeups based on several conditions. Currently it just provides limited functionality and a crude command line interface.
