Bitcoin dealer
==============

Bitcoin dealer is simple Django program (trading bot) for trading bitcoins currently only on Bitstamp exchange.

Although program is really simple, it supports [stop orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_%28exchange%29#Stop_orders) and maybe something more, but I am not really familiar with trading techniques and jargon.

Program is most useful for those who do not have time to watch price of bitcoin all the time, have a PC running all the time and know how to write few "Hello worlds" with two if cases.

* Run: python manage.py syncdb This will create database schema, tables and load intial_data.json to database.
* Change following variables in settings.py (under EXCHANGES):
 - bitstamp -> key = 'you get this in mtgox admin page'
 - bitstamp -> secret = 'you get this also in mtgox admin page'
 - check_interval = 2

Troubleshooting
---------------
If paths for running script cannot be found and you get errors, set following variables:

export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=bitcoin_dealer.settings

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/your_path_to_one_path_less_than_bitcoin_dealer/ 

bitcoin_dealer is the name of the folder you have cloned this project. If you have bitcoin_dealer in **/programs/bitcoin_dealer/** then you should export **PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/programs/**.

Info
----
Right now you should not change status of trades, since API v1 still does not support that (but it will have effect on other related trades if you change status from **selling** to **sold** for example). Just leave it as it is. If you would like cancel trade, go to your Bitstamp account and cancel trades/orders; but be careful to deactivate/cancel related first.

WARNING
-------
Watch out, settings.py should be accessible only to you, your account and with your permissions.

Program works correctly only if you have enough funds (bitcoins, $, â‚¬, ...) on your Bitstamp account. There is no checking if you do not have enough coins or money on your account.

Every time you do "python manage.py syncdb" tables exchange_currency, exchange_exchange and exchange_exchange_currencies will be overwritten by data from initial_data.json.

There is no [south](http://south.aeracode.org/) or similar support implemented. There are database differences between revisions. At worst case, backup old database, do "python manage.py syncdb" and "restore by hand".

Developers
----------
With little effort, support for other exchanges can be added also. Database models and program itself is designed with that in mind. However, script which is responsible for trading (scripts/dealing.py), supports Bitstamp, Mtgox. But until good fairy comes and saves Mtgox and Kerpeles, Mtgox exchange is disabled by default.
