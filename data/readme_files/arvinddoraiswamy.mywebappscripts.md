This ReadMe is just a list of the Burp extensions and other scripts I have here. For details look at the file extensions_brief_summary or download the code itself :)

1. Search and fuzz all valid directories on a website
2. Detect CSRF tokens in requests
3. Detecting invalid Referers in case a Referer is used for protecting against CSRF
4. Download all JS files on a site
5. Record all cookies and their attributes
6. Record third party referers
7. Identify candidates for URL redirection, LFI and RFI
8. Detect version information leakage in headers or response bodies
9. Remove session cookie and reissue request to check Direct requests
10. Test PUT and DELETE on every single directory that you browse
11. Scan all SSL hosts in Proxy history
12. A couple of per_request_decoders of key parts of the request.
13. Extension which makes Direct requests as a request appears in Proxy History
14. Make requests without some cookies to identify which cookie is useful
15. Fuzz the antiCSRF token to check if random tokens are valid
16. One click to set positions for requests in Intruder
17. Toggle request method for every request and see if anything changes
18. Clickjacking POC generator
19. Wrapper to try and fuzz file upload features

Other scripts/tools/fuzz lists/misc :)

1. Request every single HTTPS request over HTTP
2. Custom fuzzing lists for specific situations
3. Code for all extensions has been modularized. List of functions in modules is present in modules/modules_functions_readme

Tips:
1. Add 2 slashes for configuring your modules path on Windows. Every extension needs this - as of now extensions search for webcommon.py inside a directory called 'modules' - this is in the same directory as all the Burp Extensions. An example would be C:\\tools\\extensions\\modules\\. A single slash is enough for Linux systems.

2. Some extensions work best as you browse the application. Others work best when the entire application is browsed and you have all your requests inside Burp's history. Refer the file 'scripts_brief_summary' before starting to work.
