# DRM Removal Tools for eBooks

## This repo is no longer maintained!

> The old readme.md has been moved to [old-readme.md](old-readme.md).

#### Why is this repo here?

On [Nov 27, 2012](https://github.com/psyrendust/dedrm-ebook-tools/commit/af856f53afb7fb22699cabbee216477da0752335) I created this repo because the author of the tools, [@apprenticeharper](https://github.com/apprenticeharper), did not have a GitHub repo for the tools. I am not the author of these tools. I just wanted to keep them in a safe place. This repository is just a copy of the tools downloaded from [Apprentice Alf's Blog](http://www.apprenticealf.wordpress.com).

#### What do I do now?

On [Feb 28, 2015](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/releases/tag/v1.0), [@apprenticeharper](https://github.com/apprenticeharper) created their own [GitHub repo for DeDRM Tools](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools), which replaces the need for this repo. Please see [https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools) for all releases and updates.

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
