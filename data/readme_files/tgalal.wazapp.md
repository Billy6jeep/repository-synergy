Wazapp
======

Wazapp is an IM application for N9 that allows you to chat with your Whatsapp buddies

Wazapp consists of 2 parts, the IM application (wazapp), which is in Python, 
and the accounts plugin (waxmppplugin) in C++. The accounts plugin
should be rewritten in python soon.

**Wazapp is powered by [Yowsup](https://github.com/tgalal/yowsup), the python Whatsapp Library**
