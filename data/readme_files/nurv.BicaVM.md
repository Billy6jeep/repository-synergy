BicaVM
======

This project is an implementation of a JVM in JavaScript. At the
moment it runs Java code, but is more like a proof of concept than a
real JVM. A lot of work is required to make this JVM run Java code
(including writing an entire runtime enviroment).

Installation
============

1. Check out the code from GitHub
2. make - A webserver will start
3. Point the latest version of Chrome to http://0.0.0.0:8080/

What it can / can't do at this point
==========================

BicaVM can interpret a big chunk of the JVM's bytecode (probably around
60%). However, it is wildy incomplete. It has a JNI interface that maps to
JavaScript functions. It has no JIT compilation.
