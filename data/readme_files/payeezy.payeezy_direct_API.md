# Payeezy Direct API

User Action: Buyer does a checkout on the merchant hosted site by clicking on buy/submit button. This needs to be a secure page.

1. Upon Submit the form gets posted to the Merchant server
2. Merchantâ€™s backend server invokes the Payeezy API over a SSL connection and submits the order information securely. The call 
   requires providing an authorization header with a HMAC hash. Refer to API docs section for more information on this.
3. Payeezy process the transactions (such as authorize, purchase) with the provided transaction details and sends back the response
