## Building, Testing, and Installation

### Linux

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/pick-colour-picker)

```bash
snap install pick-colour-picker
```

### Source

You'll need the following dependencies:

  * `gir1.2-dee-1.0`
  * `gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0`
  * `gir1.2-glib-2.0`
  * `gir1.2-gtk-3.0`
  * `gir1.2-unity-5.0`
  * `python3-cairo`
  * `python3-gi`
  * `python3-gi-cairo`

Pick can be run from the checkout with `python3 -m pick`. 

A `setup.py` is present, so `python3 setup.py install` is possible, but beware that [uninstalling setup.py-installed apps is not as easy as it should be](https://github.com/stuartlangridge/ColourPicker/issues/62) and prepare accordingly if you plan to use this install method.
