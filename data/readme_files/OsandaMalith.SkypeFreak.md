The Freak series:
-----------------
We are trying to develop some standalone forensic programs for various computer applications. These programs will be later joined together to make a single feature full forensic framework capable of analysing various computer applications. Currently the following programs have been developed but please keep this in mind that they are still in beta:
* [SkypeFreak](#)
* [ChromeFreak](https://github.com/OsandaMalith/chromefreak)

Compatibility:
--------------
The program works with Python *2.6* upto *3.x*
Supported Operating Systems:
* Windows
* Linux
* Mac OS X

TODO:
------
* Use optparse to get input
* further simplify the code
* Make a more usable API
* Allow the export of data in csv form

Contribution:
-------------
You can contribute by adding any functionality from the TODO list and sending a pull request. We will take a look at your code and merge your changes.
