# Running scripts
There are two options for running scripts:
  1. Create a script directory and set ```PYTHONPATH``` to the newly created script directory and add your scripts here.
  2. Copy scripts to the root of your windbg directory. Something like: ```%ProgramFiles%\Debugging Tools for Windows\```.
Once your script path is setup, scripts are run from the windbg console as follows:
```
> .load pykd
> !py <script_name>
```

# Installing and running plugins
The recommended way to install scripts is to add the plugins directory of this project to your ```PYTHONPATH```.
Another option is to follow the second option described above in the ```Running scripts``` section. Simply copy the plugin scripts to the root of your windbg directory.
