## Former home of webthree-umbrella (cpp-ethereum)

[cpp-ethereum](http://cpp-ethereum.org) is the [Ethereum](http://ethereum.org) C++ client.

This repository was an "umbrella" repository which was the home for the various C++
projects betwen October 2015 and August 2016.   Prior to that point all the work had happened
under a single repository (**cpp-ethereum**), and that is where all C++ runtime development
work has now returned, with **solidity** now being a standalone repository.

- [AlethZero, AlethOne and AlethFive](https://github.com/ethereum/alethzero) have been retired
- [Mix](https://github.com/ethereum/mix) has been retired
- [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) is now standalone, and development continues in that repo
- The restored [cpp-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum) repository is the mainline for the C++ runtime client
    - That is a merger of the **libethereum, libweb3core, webthree** and **webthree-helpers** repositories

Please do not create pull-requests against this repository.  It is no longer in-use.
