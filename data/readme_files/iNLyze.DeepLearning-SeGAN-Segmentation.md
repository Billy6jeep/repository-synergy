# DeepLearning SeGAN Segmentation
This contains an implementation of the SeGAN model for semantic segmentation introduced in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.01805.pdf

The model serves for semantic segmentation of image data and the authors have demonstrated its utility on cranial MRT images.

A summary of the model architecture from the paper is shown below
