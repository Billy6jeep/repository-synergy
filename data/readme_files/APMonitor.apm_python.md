APMonitor Optimization Suite

The APMonitor Modeling Language is optimization software for mixed-integer and differential algebraic equations. It is coupled with large-scale solvers for linear, quadratic, nonlinear, and mixed integer programming (LP, QP, NLP, MILP, MINLP). Modes of operation include data reconciliation, real-time optimization, dynamic simulation, and nonlinear predictive control. It is freely available through MATLAB, Python, or from a web browser interface.

Compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3+.

The APMonitor has a newer interface through the [GEKKO Optimization Suite](https://gekko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). See a [list of 18 examples](https://apmonitor.com/wiki/index.php/Main/GekkoPythonOptimization) to get started with GEKKO.
