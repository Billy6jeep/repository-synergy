Flower
======

.. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/benoitc/flower.png?branch=master
    :target: http://travis-ci.org/benoitc/flower

collection of modules to build distributed and reliable concurrent
systems in Python.

::

    a = “”

    def f():
       print(a)

    def hello():
        a = "hello, world"
        tasklet(f)()

Requirements
------------

- Python from 2.6 to 3.x
- A platform supported by `libuv <https://github.com/joyent/libuv>`

Simple example
--------------

A simple example showing how to create a simple echo server.

.. code-block:: python

    # Echo server program
    from flower import tasklet, run
    from flower.net import Listen


    # handle the connection. It return data to the sender.
    def handle_connection(conn):
        while True:
            data = conn.read()
            if not data:
                break

            conn.write(data)


    # Listen on tcp port 8000 on localhost
    l = Listen(('127.0.0.1', 8000), "tcp")
    try:
        while True:
            try:

                # wait for new connections (it doesn't block other tasks)
                conn, err = l.accept()

                # Handle the connection in a new task.
                # The loop then returns to accepting, so that
                # multiple connections may be served concurrently.

                t = tasklet(handle_connection)(conn)
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                break
    finally:
        l.close()

    run()


And the echo client::

    from flower import tasklet, run, schedule
    from flower.net import Dial


    # connect to the remote server
    conn = Dial("tcp", ('127.0.0.1', 8000))

    # start to handle the connection
    # we send a string to the server and fetch the
    # response back

    for i in range(3):
        msg = "hello"
        print("sent %s" % msg)
        resp = conn.write(msg)
        ret = conn.read()
        print("echo: %s" % ret)

    conn.close()
    run()


Installation
------------

Flower requires Python superior to 2.6 (yes Python 3 is supported)

To install flower using pip you must make sure you have a
recent version of distribute installed::

    $ curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
    $ sudo python distribute_setup.py
    $ easy_install pip


For now flower can only be installed from sources. To install or upgrade to the latest released version of flower::

    $ git clone https://github.com/benoitc/flower.git
    $ cd flower && pip install -r requirements.txt
