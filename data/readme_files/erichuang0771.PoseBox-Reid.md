A two-stream Re-id CNN network

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07732


## Components:

1) Models:

   The folder holds all trained models

2) ExtractFeatures:

   Shows how to extract features using our model
   
3) Fusion:

   Shows how to merge two pertrain Caffe Models into one two-stream network

4) DataMaker:

   Shows how to generate poseBox data based on pose estimation results and how to prepare hdf5 data for our model training 

## TODO:

   finish how-to-training part
