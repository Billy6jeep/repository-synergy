# NNProject - DeepMask

This is a Keras-based Python implementation of DeepMask- a complex deep neural network for learning object segmentation masks. The full article can be found here: [Learning to Segment Object Candidates](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06204).

This was implemented as a final project for TAU Deep Learning course (2016).

### General instructions
1. Install all requirements, as listed below
2. Download mscoco annotations (see below)
3. Download and convert graph weights with HeplerScripts/CreateVggGraphWeights.py (see below)
4. Create the learning dataset using ExamplesGenerator.py
5. Create a train and test directories with examples to train and test on. Default locations are 'Predictions/train' and same for test (can be configured in EndToEnd.py)
6. Run EndToEnd.py

### Required installations
This was run on Windows 8.1 (64 bit) on a CPU with 8GB RAM. In brackets are the versions I used.

- Python
  - [Anaconda for Windows x64 with Python 2.7](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (Anaconda version 2.4.1)
- Theano (0.8.0.dev0)
  - conda install mingw libpython
  - git clone https://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
  - python setup.py install
- Keras (0.3.1)
  - NOTICE- if you get an error regarding the 'Graph' object, you are probably not using the correct Keras version
- Open CV (3.1.0)
  - Download installation [here](http://opencv.org/)
  - Copy cv2.pyd to site-packages dir inside python's lib dir in anaconda
- Coco API (1.0.1)
  - git clone https://github.com/pdollar/coco
  - python setup.py build_ext install

### Required downloads
- VGG-D
  - Net was taken from [here](https://gist.github.com/baraldilorenzo/07d7802847aaad0a35d3). Weights should be downloaded locally, and converted to graph format using **HelperScripts/CreateVggGraphWeights.py**
