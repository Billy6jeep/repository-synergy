## DeepFolding
This is a re-implemention of [Sheng and Jinbo's deep learning model](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005324) on protein contacts prediction, which is a breakthrough in protein structure prediction. Unfortunately they did not opensource their codes and models. Hence, I re-implemented their methods based on the paper. As their paper reported, deep learning model can significantly improve the accuracy of contacts prediction.
