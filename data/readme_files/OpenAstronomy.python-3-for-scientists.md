A work-in-progress guide to features of Python 3 that are useful for scientists.

The goal of this document is to convince working scientists who use python
for day-to-day work to transition from Python 2.7 to Python 3.

Things we explicitly want to avoid:

* Trashing Python 2.7
* Code shaming

Strategies we want to employ:

* Motivate with cool new features
* Provide tools/workflows/suggestions to ease the transition
