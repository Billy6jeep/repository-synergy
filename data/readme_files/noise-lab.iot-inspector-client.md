# Princeton IoT Inspector

IoT Inspector is a standalone desktop app that lets you analyze your home IoT devices. It allows you to determine

* who your IoT devices are communicating with
* when the communication happens
* how many bytes are sent and received over time

These features will help you identify potential problems on your home network, including

* security problems (e.g., your camera sending out lots of traffic even when you are not using it)
* privacy problems (e.g., your smart TV contacting advertising or tracking companies as you watch TV)
* performance problems (e.g., identifying who is using up the most bandwidth in your home network)
