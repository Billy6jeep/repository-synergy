# Overview
NeuroBlast is a classic arcade space shooter with ML-powered AI using TensorFlow. In this short demo intended to demonstrate the accessibility of open source tools for machine learning, you can train an enemy AI using machine learning.

## How it Works

If you want to learn more about how the game works under the hood, and for a tour of the insides, see these two blog posts:

- [Building an ML-Powered AI Using TensorFlow in Go](http://gopherdata.io/post/build_ml_powered_game_ai_tensorflow/) on GopherData.io
- [Building Game AI Using Machine Learning: Working With TensorFlow, Keras, and the Intel MKL in Python](https://www.activestate.com/blog/2017/05/building-game-ai-using-machine-learning-working-tensorflow-keras-and-intel-mkl-python)

You can also [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiorteQg9n0) my GopherCon 2017 Lightning talk about the game or [view the slides](https://github.com/gophercon/2017-talks/tree/master/lightningtalks/PeteGarcin-BuildingMLPoweredGameAIwithTensorFlow).

## Installation - Requirements

Before you start, you will require the following external libraries/tools:

- Python 3.5 or Go 1.8
- MongoDB server [Download](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community)
- TensorFlow C libraries for Go version [Instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_go)

*Note: TensorFlow for Go is only available of macOS/Linux. Windows is NOT supported.*

For any package dependencies, you can either install them via pip/dep or you can also install [ActivePython 3.5.3](https://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads) or [ActiveGo 1.8](https://www.activestate.com/activego/downloads) to have an environment with nearly all dependencies already pre-installed.

## Windows Setup Instructions

To setup the game to run on Windows in Python 3:

1. `git clone https://github.com/ActiveState/neuroblast.git`
2. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch `rungame.cmd` (which will launch the Mongo server).

## MacOS/Linux Setup Instructions

To setup the game to run on MacOS/Linux in Python 3:

1. `git clone https://github.com/ActiveState/neuroblast.git`
2. `cd neuroblast`
3. `mkdir db`
2. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch Mongo server: `mongod --dbpath ./db`
4. Launch the game `python3 game.py`

*Note: If you previously had Keras installed on your machine, and had run it using a different backend, make sure you configure your Keras backend to run using TensorFlow by following these [instructions](https://keras.io/backend/).*

To setup the game to run on MacOS/Linux in Go 1.8:

*Reminder: You must have the TensorFlow C libraries installed as per these [instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_go).*

*Note: You must clone the repo into your GOPATH, or add the folder you clone into to your GOPATH in order for `dep ensure` to work.*

1. `git clone https://github.com/ActiveState/neuroblast.git`
2. `cd go`
2. `dep ensure`
3. `go build`
4. Launch the game `./go`

## Command Line Arguments

There are a number of options available when running the game from Python:

- `-n` changes the Neural Network model from using TensorFlow to using the "home grown" network model which is useful for prototyping/debugging.
- `-f` launches the game in full screen.
- `-v` changes the visualization method to use raw Keras/TensorFlow values. Warning: This is much slower!

*Note: These options are not available in the Go version.*

## Controls

### Movement

Control your ship with the arrow keys or the left-analog stick with a gamepad.

### Firing

Use either `SPACE` or the A button on your gamepad to fire. You can hold the button down for continuous fire.

### Debug Menu Commands

On the main menu of the Python version, you can use the following commands to export debug data:

`x` - Exports a model using the SavedModelBuilder functionality to use in the Go version  
`w` - Exports weights.csv which are the trained weights of the current model  
`d` - Exports traindata.csv which is a dump of the training data points currently in memory  

## Known Issues

- Collision is not pixel-perfect
- In the Python version, being hit will slow down your rate of movement
- You can fly through the enemy ships with your ship (no collision between enemy ships/hero ship)
- Some gamepad configurations may not work
- Menu navigation with gamepad is inconsistent
