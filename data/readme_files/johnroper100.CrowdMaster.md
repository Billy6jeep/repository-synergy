# CrowdMaster

CrowdMaster is the only complete workflow for crowd simulation in Blender.

Its main features include:
* A fully node-based interface
* Procedural agent animation and generation tools
* Helper utilities for many common tasks

You can find the menus in the Node Editor inside the CrowdMaster node trees. Documentation can be found [here](http://crowdmaster.org/docs/).
