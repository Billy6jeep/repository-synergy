Every Document can be classified as e.g. bill, whitepaper, or just as a letter. But all of these documents have a structure and you know, without reading, this paper is a bill or a letter. So what if we use the logic from Face Recognition, depending on the used algorithm, eg. PCA to reduce the paper to his representative principal component. And classify the scanned paper in its Classification. Now the paperless would be able to know what for a paper was scanned and sort it."
