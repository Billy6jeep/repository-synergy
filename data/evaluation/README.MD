# Repository Synergy Mining Evaluation

## 1. DONE: Star relations between projects (repo_connections_sg_based.csv)
For most of the repositories information about owners and members are available. If a member/owner of a project marks another project with a star, this 
can indicate that the marked project is relevant for the own project. In the evaluation of the synergy ranking algorithm, pairs of repositories that
are connected through members who star the other project should be ranked higher.
